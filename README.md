# SolarpunkSynth ðŸŒžðŸŽ¹

A solar-powered synthesizer that creates experimental sounds, rhythmic patterns, and beats using minimal energy from the sun! This project embodies the spirit of solarpunk by combining sustainable energy with creative expression.

## Description

The SolarpunkSynth is an ultra-low power consumption synthesizer that can be powered by:
- Silicon solar cells
- DIY DSSC (Dye-sensitized solar cells)
- Alternative power sources (mud batteries, potato power, coconut energy)
- Nearly depleted batteries (due to extremely low power requirements)

## Project Variants

This repository contains two versions of the SolarpunkSynth:

### 1. Original SolarpunkSynth
Located in [`/SolarPunkSynth`](./SolarPunkSynth)
- The original version of the solar-powered synthesizer
- Simple and elegant design

- Developed for the Digilog exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan
- Features artistic PCB design with custom graphics
- Same core functionality with a unique visual style

![SolarpunkSynth Digilog Edition](./photos/SolarpunkSynth_digilog_3d.jpg)

## Technical Details

The synthesizer is built around these key features:
- Based on hex-inverter chip (74HC14)
- Three interdependent oscillators coupled through piezo discs
- Ultra-low energy consumption (<0.5mA)
- Audio output via 3.5mm jack
- Organic, variable rhythms through unstable circuit states
- KiCad PCB design files included

### Technical Differences Between Variants

#### Original SolarpunkSynth
- Simple and robust circuit design
- Direct audio output from oscillator circuit
- Basic component selection for easy assembly
- Standard PCB layout optimized for functionality
- Ideal for workshops and educational purposes

#### Digilog Edition Enhancements
- Added MCP6002 dual op-amp for improved audio output buffering
- Enhanced signal conditioning with additional filtering capacitors
- Modified component values for better stability
- Custom footprint library optimized for artistic PCB layout
- Artistic PCB design with custom traces and visual elements
- ENIG finish recommended for superior aesthetic presentation
- Optional acrylic cover design for finished look and protection

## DIY PCB Fabrication

For those interested in creating their own PCBs at home or in makerspaces, the Digilog edition includes DIY PCB files:
- [`SolarSynth_MASK.png`](./SolarSynth_digilog/DIY_pcb/SolarSynth_MASK.png) - Printable mask pattern for toner transfer or photolithography
- [`SolarSynth_digilog_MASK.svg`](./SolarSynth_digilog/DIY_pcb/SolarSynth_digilog_MASK.svg) - Vector version of the mask for scaling and modifications

These files can be used with common DIY PCB fabrication methods like toner transfer, photolithography, or CNC milling.

## Acrylic Cover

The Digilog edition offers an optional aesthetic acrylic cover:
- [`acrylCover_digilog.dxf`](./SolarSynth_digilog/acrylicCover_digilog/acrylCover_digilog.dxf) - CAD file for laser cutting
